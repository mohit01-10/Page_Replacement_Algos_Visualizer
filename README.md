# Page_Replacement_Algos_Visualizer
This is a Page Replacement Techniques Visualizer project.
The project is built out of python and uses the tkinter module to visualize the way 2 of the most popular Page Replacement algorithms. The algorithms visualized are:

FIFO (First come, First served)

LRU (Least Recently Used)

I built this application because I was fascinated by page replacement algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action.
Further, when solving problem related to the topics, i often did some mistake in calcultions and it was hard to pin point it.
